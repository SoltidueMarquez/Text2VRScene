            "resource/models/spaceship.gltf": "The spaceship starts on the left side of the scene, suggesting an x value that puts it to the left of the observer. The scale dictates its size in space. To maintain the aesthetic of space being vast, I calculated the position to make sure the spaceship not only appears as a tiny speck but also avoids any objects within its field, adhering to the max position limit. Starting position y is set negatively to make it visible to the observer."

Its size and positioning achieve the described movement without unnecessary overlaps, ensuring the progression from left to right as it accelerates smoothly."

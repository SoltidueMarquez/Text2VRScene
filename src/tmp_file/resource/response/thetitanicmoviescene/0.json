            "background": "The vast ocean under a starry night sky with the full moon casting a silvery glow over the water, creating an ethereal atmosphere.",
            "characters": "Rose, a slender young woman with flowing auburn hair, wears an elegant deep maroon evening gown that sways with the night breeze. Jack, with tousled brown hair and earnest blue eyes, is dressed in a simple white shirt partially hidden by a dark vest and worn trousers.",
            "objects": "The Titanic, a colossal ship with gleaming white decks and towering smokestacks, cuts through the calm sea. An iceberg, partly submerged, with its jagged peak appearing ghostly pale under the moonlight.",
            "scale": "The Titanic is extraordinarily large when compared to the human characters on deck. The iceberg, though appearing small in the distance, is larger than the visible portion of the ship as they approach.",
            "start position": "Jack and Rose are standing at the bow of the Titanic, leaning over the railing to embrace the fresh sea air. The Titanic is advancing steadily from the bottom to the top of the scene, while the iceberg lies in the center, looming ahead.",
            "movements": "The Titanic steadily moves from the bottom to the top, its powerful engines propelling it forward through the ocean. Jack and Rose, initially standing still, move closer together, with Jack extending his arms outward as Rose mirrors his gesture, both shifting slightly to the left while gazing outwards. The iceberg remains stationary, creating a sense of impending collision as the Titanic approaches."

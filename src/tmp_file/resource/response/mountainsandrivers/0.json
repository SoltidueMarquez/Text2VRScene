            "characters": "None",
            "objects": "The mountains are majestic, with peaks that reach high into the sky, covered in dense forests of deep green. The river is wide and gently flowing, its surface shimmering with the reflection of the sun.",
            "scale": "The mountains are enormous, dwarfing the river below, which appears as a thin ribbon of blue winding through the valley.",

            "movements": "The river flows steadily from the base of the mountains, meandering through the valley, its path curving gently as it moves from left to right across the scene."

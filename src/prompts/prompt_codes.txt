CONSTRAINTS:

CODE REQUIREMENT:
1. You need to generate the source code USING the 3D objects file in ".gltf" generated above, organize these objects according to the logic in the description.
2. WARNING: YOU SHOULD NOT MODIFY ANY PART OF GIVEN TEMPLATE CODE.
3. WARNING: YOU SHOULD NOT USE ANY 3D MODELS THAT ARE NOT LISTED IN THE ABOVE RESPONSE!
4. WARNING: You must avoid using pure text in the generated scene, which will cause DISASTROUS decrease of the sense of immersive.
5. WARNING: YOU SHOULD NOT MODIFY THE POSITION OF <a-sky> and <a-camera>!!
6. You should provide the complete html code, starting with "<html>" and end with "</html>", do not provide a whole html codes into several code blocks.
7. You should ensure that the generated code complies with the HTML file specifications and has no syntax errors. Ensure that the code is executable, especially without any extra escape characters like '/' or '"'.
USING scale and position attribute of 'a-entity' to adjust the RELATIVE SIZE and POSITION of different objects for matching the description above and increasing the sense of immersive!

CONSTRAINTS:

REMEMBER!!!!!
PRE-KNOWLEDGE:
0. BOTH THE POSITION AND SCALE USE "x z y" COORDINATE SYSTEM.

1. ATTENTION:
FOR Comprehending POSITION ATTRIBUTE, YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT In the position attribute "x z y"
 The first number "x" controls horizontal direction, positive value means the right side;
 The second number "z" controls lateral direction, positive value means the upper side;
 The third number "y" controls vertical direction, negative value means the front side.

2. The scale of models are listed in the given Scales.
FOR Comprehending SCALE ATTRIBUTE, YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT In the scale attribute "x z y"
 The first number "x" controls the scale in horizontal direction, which is width
 The second number "z" controls the scale in lateral direction, which is height
 The third number "y" controls the scale in vertical direction, which is length

3. Definition of OVERLAPPING:
The distance of different characters and objects can be calculated by their position as follows:
Equation of Distance between <x1, z1, y1> and <x2, z2, y2>: sqrt((x1-x2)*(x1-x2)+(z1-z2)*(z1-z2)+(y1-y2)*(y1-y2))
if the distance between two objects is smaller than the sum of their scales, then these two objects overlap.

POSITION REQUIREMENT:
1. The observer of this scene is standing at <0 0 0>, make sure the y value of objects are negative so that the objects are at the front side of the observer.
2. You should DETERMINE THE START POSITION COORDINATES "x z y" OF ALL CHARACTERS AND OBJECTS BASED ON THE GIVEN DESCRIPTION. IF THERE IS NO DESCRIPTION ABOUT POSITION, GENERATE THE POSITION COORDINATES VALUE ACCORDING TO COMMON KNOWLEDGE BASED ON THE SCENE.
3. YOU MUST CONSIDER THE GIVEN SCALES OF EACH OBJECT FIRST, THEN SET THE start POSITION OF EACH OBJECT THAT AVOIDING NONSENSE OVERLAPPING BETWEEN TWO OBJECTS.
OVERLAPPING MEANS THE DISTANCE OF TWO OBJECTS CALCULATED BY POSITION IS SMALLER THAN THEIR SCALES.
4. ATTENTION!!! : For two objects have position relation such as stand, sit, holding, etc. Make sure they are in the same place with slight position difference based on they position relation.
5. The MAXIMUM OF POSITION IN EACH DIRECTION IS 100.

FORMAT:
1. WARNING: YOU SHOULD NOT ADD ANY EXTRA 3D MODEL!!
2. ATTENTION: IF YOU NEED TO DELETE MODELS, YOU SHOULD NOT DELETE CHARACTER MODELS FIRST.
3. ATTENTION!: USE "\n" TO SEPARATE EACH SENTENCE.
4. You should only respond in JSON format as described below and do not add extra explanations excluding the JSON response

RESPONSE FORMAT:
{
    "responses":
    {
    "reason for position":{"file path of 3D models" : "reasons for the determined position below.",
    "file path of 3D models" : "reasons for the determined position below."}
    "position": {"file path of 3D models":"x z y",
    "file path of 3D models":"x z y"},
    "explaination":"explain the reason of these responses"
    }
}

8. Ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads

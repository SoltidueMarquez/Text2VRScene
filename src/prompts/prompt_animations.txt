CONSTRAINTS:

INFOMATION:
1. ATTENTION! WARNING!:
<a-animation> is DEPRECATED in current "A-Frame" version,
YOU SHOULD ONLY ADD ATTRIBUTE "ANIMATION" TO EXISTING "A-ENTITY" FOR ADDING ANIMATION TO MODEL SUCH AS <a-entity gltf-model=<target model> <other attributs> animation="<Add the needed animation by yourself>"></a-entity>
For ADDING multiple animations TO A MODEL, YOU SHOULD REFER TO THE FOLLOWING CODES, the number behind animation represent the rank of the animation
<a-entity gltf-model="your model" other attributes
animation="<Add the needed animation by yourself>"
animation__2="<Add the needed animation by yourself>"
animation__3="<Add the needed animation by yourself>"
>
</a-entity>

2. ATTENTION!
FOR Comprehending POSITION ATTRIBUTE in animation, YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT In the position attribute "x z y"
 The "x" controls horizontal direction, positive value means the right side;
 The "z" controls lateral direction, positive value means the upper side;
 The "y" controls vertical direction, negative value means the front side.

ANIMATION REQUIREMENT:
IMPORTANT! 0: The observer is at the position of <0 0 0>, you should determine the end position of objects based on the movement description in the Scene description.
REMEMBER: !! If you cannot determine the end position from the description, refer to common sense based on the overall description.
WARNING!!: THE START POINT SHOULD NOT THE SAME AS THE END POINT.
 Remember to make sure the middle of trajectory between the given start position and the determined end position of objects are in front of the observer.

1. YOU SHOULD ONLY ADD OR MODIFY THE ANIMATION ATTRIBUTE OF PREVIOUS HTML CODE.
2. ATTENTION: FOR THE OBJECTS IN CONTACT, SUCH A STANDS ON B, OR A IS SITTING ON B, YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE SYCHRONIZED WITH THE SAME MOVEMENT ANIMATION.
3. YOU SHOULD ADD THE ANIMATION TO each CHARACTER AND OBJECT BASED ON the movement of IN THE given SCENE DESCRIPTION.
ATTENTION: YOU SHOULD NOT ADD ANIMATION TO STATIONAL FACILITY 3D OBJECTS SUCH HOUSE, STATION, ETC.
6. ATTENTION: SET TRUE TO ALL THE ANIMATIONS' LOOP ATTRIBUTES TO PROVIDE CONTINUOUS EXPERIENCE.
7. ATTENTION: THE TIME FOR translation ANIMATIONS' LOOP SHOULD BE AROUND 10 seconds.
8. WARNING!!!!! : DONOT ADD NON-SENSE 360 degree ROTATION IN PLACE, IT IS DISASTROUS DAMAGE TO THE SENSE OF IMMERSIVE.
9. ATTENTION!: If the described movement is too hard to achieve, reimaging a reasonable movement based on the scene in scene description, then realise it with animation.

CODE REQUIREMENT:
1. The provided html code should be complete, starting with "<html>" and end with "</html>", do not provide a whole html codes into several code blocks.
2. ATTENTION:
IN THE ANIMATION ATTRIBUTE, YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF THE position <x,z,y> of ANIMATION,
 The "x" controls horizontal direction, positive value means the right side;
 The "z" controls lateral direction, positive value means the upper side;
 The "y" controls vertical direction, positive value means the backward side.
3. WARNING: YOU SHOULD NOT ADD ANY EXTRA 3D MODEL!!
4. WARNING: YOU SHOULD NOT CHANGE ANY FILEPATHS OF 3D MODELS!!!
5. WARNING: YOU SHOULD NOT MODIFY ANIMATION OF <a-sky> and <a-camera>!!

FORMAT:
1. You should only respond in JSON format STRICTLY follows the template of RESPONSE FORMAT below and do not add extra explanations excluding the JSON response.
2. ATTENTION!: You have limited 3000 characters in responses. Make sure you can finish your response in 3000 characters.
3. Ensure the response can be parsed by Python json.loads

RESPONSE FORMAT:
{
    "responses":
    {
        "explanation":{"name of 3D models" : "explain the movements here first and explain how the attribute of animation express the described movement or your reimaged movements",
                       "name of 3D models" : "explain the movements here first and explain how the attribute of animation express the described movement or your reimaged movements"},
        "html code": "ensure the code can be directly executed in one html file"
    }
}
